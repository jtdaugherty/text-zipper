-- |This module provides a two-dimensional text zipper data structure.
-- This structure represents a body of text and an editing cursor
-- which can be moved throughout the text, along with a set of editing
-- transformations.
--
-- Text zippers are generalized over the set of data types that might
-- be used to store lists of characters (e.g., 'String', 'T.Text',
-- etc.).  As a result, the most general way to create a text zipper
-- is to use 'mkZipper' and provide all of the functions required to
-- manipulate the underlying text data.
--
-- Implementations using 'T.Text' and 'String' are provided.
